# TriviaGame
In this project I used JS for the logic and Jquery to manipulate the HTML.  I used timers and intervals for the timer.
Creted multiple functions to break the code apart and try to avoid confussion.
The challening part was displaying the correct screen based on the answer and make sure the app kept the correct score.
